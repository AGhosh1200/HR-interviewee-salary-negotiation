To check whether it's feasible for the company to pay him 160K or not for his position(that is somewhere halfway between regional manager and partner, since it requires a minimum of 4 years of experience to be a partner from a regional manager but he has only 2) the HR team runs various non-linear regression models using csv file of salaries of other positions.
The models used are-
1. Support Vector Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
